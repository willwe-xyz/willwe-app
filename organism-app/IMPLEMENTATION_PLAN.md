## Risk Management

### Technical Risks
- **Performance Issues**: Implement LOD system early
- **Complex Orbital Mechanics**: Start with simplified physics
- **Data Integration**: Test with real blockchain data early
- **Browser Compatibility**: Regular testing on multiple browsers

### Timeline Risks
- **Scope Creep**: Stick to planned features for each phase
- **Technical Debt**: Regular refactoring sessions
- **Dependencies**: Have backup plans for external libraries
- **Resource Constraints**: Prioritize core functionality first

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- **Performance**: Maintain 60fps on average hardware
- **Load Time**: Under 3 seconds for initial load
- **Memory Usage**: Under 512MB peak consumption
- **Error Rate**: Under 0.1% operation failures

### User Experience Metrics
- **Ease of Use**: Users can complete basic operations within 2 minutes
- **Discoverability**: Search functionality used within first session
- **Engagement**: Average session duration > 5 minutes
- **Completion Rate**: > 90% successful operation completion

## Development Guidelines

### Code Standards
- Follow TypeScript strict mode
- Use functional components with hooks
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Write comprehensive tests for core functionality

### Git Workflow
- Feature branches for each component
- Regular commits with descriptive messages
- Code review for all major changes
- Automated testing before merges

### Documentation
- Inline code comments for complex logic
- Component documentation with examples
- API documentation for custom hooks
- User guide for new features

This implementation plan provides a structured approach to building the solar system interface while maintaining flexibility for adjustments based on development progress and user feedback.
